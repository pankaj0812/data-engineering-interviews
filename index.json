This approach is basic and has the time complexity of O(n**2).\nReferences:\n  https://use-the-index-luke.com/sql/join/nested-loops-join-n1-problem\n  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfuLUE7lccs\n  What is \u0026lsquo;hash join\u0026rsquo;? ⭐️ Hash join is an optimizaton approach database engine may take to speed up a process of tables join. In this case, a in-memory hash table(s) is being generated using the values of the 'left' table's join key column(s). The hash table values are used afterward to find matching rows of the 'right' table. The hash join approach is faster compared to the nested loops join, it however has a limitation: whole hash table must fit into memory of the database machine. Another pro of hash join is, one doesn't need to index join key columns. The time complexity of such algorithm is O(n_left + n_right), where n_left = number of 'left' table's rows, n_right = number of 'right' table's rows.\nReferences:\n  https://use-the-index-luke.com/sql/join/hash-join-partial-objects\n  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlokdBiaMek\n  When hash join may be selected by optimizer? 🚀 TBD\nReferences:\n link1  What\u0026rsquo;s the difference between transactional and analytics databases? 👶 TBD\nReferences:\n link1  What\u0026rsquo;s the difference between star and snowflake schema? 👶 TBD\nReferences:\n link1  Exlapin data normalization process?
